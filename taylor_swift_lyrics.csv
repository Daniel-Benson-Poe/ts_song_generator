Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,3,I watched you laughing from the passenger side and,21,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,3,Realized I loved you in the fall,22,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,3,And then the cold came,23,2010

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,3,And how you held me in your arms that September night,34,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,3,The first time you ever saw me cry,35,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,3,Maybe this is wishful thinking,36,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,3,Probably mindless dreaming,37,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,3,But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right,38,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Back To December,3,"I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't",39,2010

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,8,You're in the car on the way to the movies,15,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,8,And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off,16,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,8,At 14 there's just so much you can't do,17,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,8,And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots,18,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,8,But don't make her drop you off around the block,19,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,8,Remember that she's getting older too,20,2010

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,8,"Remember the footsteps, remember the words said",30,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Never Grow Up,8,And all your little brother's favorite songs,31,2010

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,"Ha, time for a little revenge",2,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and,3,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,"I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him",4,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,"She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause",5,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,She took him faster than you can say sabotage,6,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,"I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it",7,2010

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling,21,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things,22,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know,23,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,10,Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go,24,2010

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,11,Lost your balance on a tightrope,3,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,11,Lost your mind trying to get it back,4,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,11,Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?,5,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Innocent,11,Always a bigger bed to crawl into,6,2010

Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,14,When they gave us our trophies,23,2010
Taylor Swift,Speak Now,Long Live,14,And we held them up for our town,24,2010
